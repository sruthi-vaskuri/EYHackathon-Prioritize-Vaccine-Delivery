## Problem Statement
  #### Priority Vaccine Delivery
  Help save lives and reduce the chain of transmission
  with AI enabled prioritization of vaccine delivery.
  As the country gears to unveil, register and approve its
  choice of vaccine candidates against COVID-19, the first
  set of population expected to be immunized are likely to
  be the frontline health workers, doctors, citizens over 50
  years of age and citizens with co-morbidities. The
  challenge for the healthcare administrators will be to
  prioritize this population, considering the limited
  availability of vaccines initially and at the same time,
  limiting the spread of COVID-19.
  
## Objective
  Creating a predictive model to help make
  informed decisions/insights around
  epidemiological and vaccine supply
  circumstances and priority group segments that
  need to be recommended for vaccination. The
  proposed AI algorithm/solution should have a
  user interface (e.g. web enabled) to interact with
  data for visualization, analysis as well as support
  for API integration and containerization (K8s/
  Docker are encouraged).
  
## Solution 
  To reduce the transmission of covid-19 virus we have to supply 
  the limited available vaccines by giving priorities to the states or areas 
  having the following standards
  * More covid cases based on the population in particular states.
  #Eg: States with same number of covid cases but differ in population we should 
  prefer the highly populated state among those.
  * High count of old aged people suffering from covid.
  * People having health issues i.e comorbidities along with covid.
  * High density of population.
  * Preference to frontline health workers
  This leads to decline of transmission of covid virus.
